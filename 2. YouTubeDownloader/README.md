#2. YouTubeDownloader.py
YouTubeDownloader.py

Intro:
- The purpose of this app is to allow users to download videos from YouTube at the desired resolution and framerate based on the URL provided. This app is my first Python Application since 2016. I became a bit rusty on syntax and libraries, so this was a quick refresher for me

Functionality:
- This app uses Tkinter and PyTube libraries to provide a GUI and display data on YouTube Videos based on URL.
- Future functionality will allow the app to have a dropdown menu to select the resolution, provide a thumbnail and title of the video, a progress bar, and finally, playlist/queue support.
