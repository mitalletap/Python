#1. WeatherApp.py
WeatherApp.py

Intro:
- This app is my first Python Application since 2016. I became a bit rusty on syntax and libraries, so this was a quick refresher for me

Functionality:
- This app uses Tkinter and Request libraries to provide a GUI and display data on weather for a specific location.
- You can search based on City or Zip, with the added choice of Country to return the city name, temperature, low and high for the day, and cloud forecast
